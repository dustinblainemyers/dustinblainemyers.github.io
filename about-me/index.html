    <h2>Hi everyone , </h2>
    <p>My name is Dustin Myers and I would like to thank you for stopping by. I am a naturally gregarious person and I very much enjoy learning about and interacting with people. I encourage you to reach out to me for any reason , even if it is just to bounce ideas off one another.</p>
    <p>I live in Forsyth County , Ga with my girlfriend of six years and our two dogs. Forsyth County is 30-40 minutes from Alpharetta , north of Atlanta. I am extremely proud to say that we bought our first house in 2018 and I look forward to raising our future kids there.
    </p>
    <p>I am thrilled to be attending Digital Crafts . When I first visited Atlanta tech village I was amazed by the atmosphere. I believe that the collaboration and networking opportunities along are going to be worth the journey. I have done a lot of research and I sincerely believe that Digital Crafts will be the incubator makes our entire cohort shine even brighter. I know that you get out what you put in , and I am prepared to give this everything I have for the next four months. I hope to develop lifelong friendships and colleagues . I look forward to collaborating with my peers on our never-ending journey in development excellence. 

    </p>

  

      
      
   

    <p>I have completed one round of #100DaysOfCode on <a href="https://twitter.com/dustinmyers_dev">Twitter</a>.  I love its community and how everyone supports one another.  My next goal is to begin posting regularly again .  This time I hope to post full blog articles about what I am learning , instead of the limited 140-character 100DaysOfCode messges.</p>
