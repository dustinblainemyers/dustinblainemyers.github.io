/*
Vison:

This function takes no parameters, yet .  I understand that it will need to to have parameters to qualify as "functional programming".  Later I may wrap this as a method inside of a class that I create.

Description:

This function is meant to be called from an event listener.  It declares a variable , playerSelection, and sets it equal to the playerInput HTML element.

function startGame() {
    // let x = document.getElementById("game");
    // let y = document.getElementById("startGame");
    
    // x.style.display = "block";
    document.getElementById("game").style.display = "block"; 
    document.getElementById("startGame").style.display = "none";
